Learning Angular with NX â€“ Best Practices and Deployment

This repository serves as my learning ground for Angular, focusing on best practices and deployment strategies within an NX workspace. The foundation of my learning is based on Effective Angular by Roberto Hecker, but I also incorporate additional topics that pique my interest at any given moment.

The goal of this repository is to not only solidify my Angular knowledge but also to explore real-world techniques related to scalable architecture, testing, CI/CD, performance optimization, and modern deployment workflows.
